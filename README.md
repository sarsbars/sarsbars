# About me

Hi, I’m Sarah Mitchell a recent graduate of the Software Developer program at Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology with a strong foundation in full-stack development. I’m passionate about building innovative solutions and ready to contribute as a Junior Full-Stack Developer.

Before entering the Software Developer program at Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology I worked as an Educational Assistant for 10 years and loved helping students learn and grow. These experiences taught me patience, adaptability, and the importance of clear communication.

Growing up, I loved video games and tech. Taking computer science at the University of Manitoba sparked my passion—though life had other plans. My passion for coding never faded. I pursued my dreams at MITT and now create impactful solutions in the ever-evolving tech world.
